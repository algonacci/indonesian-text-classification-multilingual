# Notebook Source Code
Except the `/result_analysis` directory, any notebooks in this directory was originally a Kaggle kernel. I have provided the `.ipynb` file in this directory along with links to the original Kaggle kernel. The naming is slightly different from the original:
* `trip_advisor` means the data is from  [(Farhan & Khodra, 2017)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320832619_Sentiment-specific_word_embedding_for_Indonesian_sentiment_analysis)
* `prosa` means the data is from [(Crisdayanti & Purwarianti, 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8904199/)
* `toxic` means the data is from [(Ibrohim & Budi, 2019)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-3506.pdf)
